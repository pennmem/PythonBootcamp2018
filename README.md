# PythonBootcamp2018

Jupyter notebooks for the 2018 CML Python / Data analysis Bootcamp

A good place to start is Numpy.ipynb and Pandas.ipynb

Plotting with matplotlib (matplotlib.ipynb) was covered several days later, but that notebook only depends on general Python and numpy knowledge. 

The schedule for the bootcamp is included in the repository (bootcamp2018_schedule.pdf).
